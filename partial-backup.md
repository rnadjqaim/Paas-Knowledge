- A transaction process system (TPS) is an information processing system for business transactions involving the collection, modification and retrieval of all transaction data. Characteristics of a TPS include performance, reliability and consistency. TPS is also known as
transaction processing or real-time processing.

- backup : is the process of making a copy of data to seperate media to prevent the loss
of data 
-recovery is opposite proccess, rstored or copied back into the operational system.
- two type of backup : full, partial 

-  ----------------------------------full backup--------------------
-    **full backup copies : all data within a system, every file in each directory of 
 the systems hard disk or soild state drive.
 -  soild state drive  : SSD: an SSD isn't the same as a hard drive. Hard drives use magnetically sensitive
   platters which are moved by a motor, whereas  an SSD uses flash memory without any moving parts, meaning they are faster.

-full backup : easiest to restore, as you only need the most ful backup file to restore 
the system, taking long time and require large amount of storage and consume resources on the network 
-----------------------------------------partial backup------------------
-  partial backup : is completed to save time and resources.
- only file changed since the last full backup are stored. 
- to perform partial backup, you need to be a full backup performed first, then on a more
- frequent basis, partik backups are made.

-two type of partial backup : 
1. differential backup ===  copies all files that have been created or changed since
2. the last full backup. files dont get marked as being backed up , when make reconver, the ladt full backup is restored, 
3. , then the last differential backup to fully last differntial backup to fully retrive the files

4.  incremnetal backup == backups files have been created or changed since the last full
or incremental backup. when recovering the files, recovering files includes the ladste full backup 
but also involves each incremental backup
