# platform as service
develpoers manage apps and data othervisr the host host provider control (hardware, os and memory storage ) 

-PaaS can be delivered through public, private and hybrid clouds to deliver services such as application hosting and Java development.
-Other PaaS services include the following:

development team collaboration;
application design and development;
application testing and deployment;
web service integration;
information security; and
database integration.
- With PaaS, a provider offers more of the application stack than IaaS, adding OSes, middleware -- such as databases -- and other runtimes into the cloud environment. PaaS products include AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Google App Engine.

hybrid PaaS;
communications PaaS (CPaaS);
mobile Paas (mPaaS);
open PaaS;
integration platform as a service (iPaaS);
database as a service (DBaaS); and
middleware as a service (MWaaS)'

------------------iPaaS---------------
An iPaaS, or integration Platform as a Service, is a platform that standardizes how applications are integrated into an organization, making it easier to automate business processes and share data across applications.

By leveraging iPaaS technologies, growing companies can eliminate manual processes and reduce dependency on spreadsheets and email, while increasing visibility, speed, and accuracy across their organization.

-Public PaaS vendors offer middleware that enables developers to set up, configure and control servers and databases without needing to set up the infrastructure



- Hybrid PaaS. Combining public and private PaaS, hybrid PaaS affords companies the flexibility of infinite capacity provided by a public PaaS with the cost efficiencies and control of owning an internal infrastructure in private PaaS. Hybrid PaaS uses a hybrid cloud.


- Integration platform as a service. IPaaS is a broad umbrella for services used to integrate disparate workloads and applications that might not otherwise communicate or interoperate natively. An iPaaS platform seeks to offer and support those disparate integrations and ease the organization's challenges in getting different workloads to work together across the enterprise.
